## Formatting Markdown Text 

Formatting Markdown text is easy! Just a few rules to learn: 

 * `*italics*`: two asterisks on either side of a word will turn it italics. *italics*
 * `__bold__`: two underscores on either side of a word will turn it bold. __bold__
 * `Superscripts^2^`: use two carrots on either side of a word or number to make it a superscript. Superscripts^2^
 * `Subscripts~2~`: use two tildes on either side of a word or number to make it a subscript. Subscripts~2~
 * `~~strikethrough~~`: use two tildes to make text strikethrough. ~~strikethrough~~
 * Use two hard returns for a new paragraph. 
 * `[R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com)` will create a link to an external website: [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com)
 * `![Alt text](path/to/image.png)`: will embed an image into the document with alternative text. 
 
If you'd like to make an unordered list, use asterisks with a space: 

 * item
 * item
 * item 
 
If you'd like an ordered list, do the same thing with numbers: 

 1. item 1
 2. item 2
 3. item 3

Be sure there is a full line gap between the start of your list and the previous line! 

Headers are also pretty easy, they go down from large to small with a single hash: 

# Biggest header

## Smaller header

### Even smaller header 

#### Smallest header

## Code-chunk options

Inserting code must take place using three open-apostrophes in a row (the open apostrophe is to the left of the number 1 key, right under the tilde). To end the code chunk, use three more open-apostrophes. 
Begin a code chunk: ` ```{r}`
End a code chunk: ` ``` `

Example: 
```{r}
# This is a code chunk. Put your R code here.
plot(cars)
```

You'll notice that the R code chunk in the markdown editor has a light gray background. If you don't see this, then it's not reading it correctly as a chunk!

Within the curly brackets, you can specify a bunch of options for how you'd like Markdown to handle the code. 

`{r, include=FALSE}` will suppress the output of the code: 
 
Example with output:
```{r, include=TRUE}
a <- 10
print(a)
```
 
Example with no output: 
```{r, include=FALSE}
a <- 10
print(a)
```
(Note that the code has been run, but there is nothing in the document!)

`{r, echo=FALSE}` will suppress the code, but not the output:

Example with suppressed code: 
```{r, echo=FALSE}
a <- 10
print(a)
```

If you would like to make a plot but not have the code show up, the best option is `echo=FALSE`:

```{r eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

You can specify more options for your code chunks, just add each to the curly braces separated by commas: 

 * `warning=FALSE` will suppress warning messages
 * `error=FALSE` will suppress error messages
 * `message=FALSE` will suppress all messages
 * `eval=FALSE` will show the code but will NOT run the chunk.
 
Note that assigning `TRUE` to any of these will produce the opposite behavior. 
 

## Basic plotting 

Basic plot: 

```{r,include=TRUE}
x.values <- c(3, 2, 5, 1, 3)
y.values <- c(1, 3, 4, 1, 2)

plot(x = x.values, y = y.values)
```

Using plot with a data frame: 

```{r,include=TRUE}
x.values <- c(3, 2, 5, 1, 3)
y.values <- c(1, 3, 4, 1, 2)

df <- data.frame(x = x.values, y = y.values)

plot(y ~ x, data = df)
```

Title and axis labels: 

```{r, include=TRUE}
data("cars")

plot(dist ~ speed, data = cars, 
     xlab = "Car speed",
     ylab  = "Stopping distance", 
     main = "Plot of speed versus stopping distance")
```

Axis limits: 

```{r, include=TRUE}
plot(dist ~ speed, data = cars,
     xlab = "Car speed",
     ylab  = "Stopping distance",
     main = "Plot of speed versus stopping distance",
     xlim = c(-5, 30), ylim = c(-50, 150))
```

#### Check Your Understanding

Make a plot of vapor pressure in mmHg versus temperature in C of mercury using the `pressure` data set. Set the axis labels and title. Make the same plot again using a different method (either with or without a formula).

```{r}
# Put your code here! 


```


### Formatting plot attributes

Plot style

```{r, include=TRUE}
plot(dist ~ speed, data = cars,
     type = "l", col = "red")
```
Options for type are `l` for line, `p` for points, or `b` for both. 

Amend plot with colors based on factors: 
```{r, include=TRUE}
# Load data set iris
data("iris")

# Establish color for each species (three total)
iriscolors <- c("red", "blue", "black")
# Plotting with colors
plot(Petal.Length ~ Petal.Width, data = iris, # Setting up basic plot
     type = "p", pch = 19, # setting point type (type) and point shape (pch)
     col = iriscolors[iris$Species]) # Establish colors that correspond to species
```


#### Check Your Understanding

Make a plot of circumference versus age of the orange trees in the data set Orange. Give each tree a unique color and point shape. 

```{r}
# Put your code here! 


```


Add to existing plots: 

```{r, include=TRUE}
data("ChickWeight")

chicks.diet1 <- subset(ChickWeight, ChickWeight$Diet == 1)
plot(x = chicks.diet1$Time, y = chicks.diet1$weight, 
     col = "red", pch = 19)

chicks.diet2 <- subset(ChickWeight, ChickWeight$Diet == 2)
points(x = chicks.diet2$Time, y = chicks.diet2$weight, 
 col = "blue", pch = 8)

# NOTE: the chicks.diet2 is cut off at the top of the plot. In order to fix this, 
# you need to alter the original plot() command with xlim and ylim. Try adding 
#   ylim = range(ChickWeight$Weight)
```

Adding lines and other stuff:
```{r, include=TRUE}
x.values <- seq(1, 10, by = 0.1)
y.values <- runif(length(x.values))
df2 <- data.frame(x = x.values, y = y.values)

plot(y ~ x, data = df2, type = "l")
points(x = df2$x, y = df2$y, pch = 10, col = "blue")
lines(x = c(-1, 11), y = c(0.65, 0.65), lty = 2)
lines(x = c(-1, 11), y = c(0.35, 0.35), lty = 3)
```

Adding a legend to the iris plot: 
```{r, include=TRUE}
iriscolors <- c("red", "blue", "black")
plot(Petal.Length ~ Petal.Width, data = iris,
     type = "p", pch = 19, col = iriscolors[iris$Species])

legend("topleft", legend = levels(iris$Species), 
       col = iriscolors, pch = rep(19, 3))
```

#### Check Your Understanding

Add a legend to your graph of Orange trees. 

```{r}
# Put your code here! 


```
